# Contributing

First off, thank you for considering contributing to async-redux-selector. 
It's people like you that make async-redux-selector a great library.

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

## Your first contribution
There are many ways to contribute:
* writing tutorials or blog posts
* improving the [documentation](README.md)
* Fix an [issue](https://github.com/RotterdamLogisticsLab/async-redux-selector/issues)
* Create or review a [pull request](https://github.com/RotterdamLogisticsLab/async-redux-selector/pulls)

Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions. 
Please consider asking usage questions ("How do I?") on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/async-redux-selector).

## Branch Organization
We will do our best to keep the master branch in good shape, with tests passing at all times. 
But in order to move fast, we will make API changes that your application might not be compatible with. 
We recommend that you use the latest stable version of async-redux-selector.

If you send a pull request, please do it against the master branch.

## Getting started

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix create an [issue](https://github.com/RotterdamLogisticsLab/async-redux-selector/issues) first.
This allows for discussion before even writing a single line of code.

### Submitting a pull request
Before submitting a pull request, please make sure you do the following:

* Create your own fork of the code
* Create your branch from `master`
* Run `npm install` in the repository root
* Update the code
* If you’ve fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!
* Ensure the tests are still passing (`npm test`)
* Make sure the code is formatted correctly (e.g. `npx prettier --write src/*`)
* Push to your newly created branch
* Create a [pull request](https://github.com/RotterdamLogisticsLab/async-redux-selector/pulls)
